## Overengineered bitmap generator
This little project was built to generate test cases for the C# coding challenge at https://edabit.com/challenge/M65kgKXa2ut4CNorv.
As the name suggests, this software is pretty overengineered, the reason for that being that I wanted to try a solution that wouldn't be the obvious one of just caching each digit as a bitmap and combining them into a single array.
